      <p>"Beauty is power; a smile is its sword."<br>
        "The task in sublimation is that of shifting the instinctual aims
        in such a way that they cannot come up against frustration from the external world.<br>
        In this, sublimation of the instincts lends its assistance. One gains the most
        if one can sufficiently heighten the yield of pleasure from the sources of intellectual work.‚Äù<br>
        -Sigmund Freud<br>
        Sublimation allows you to channel your instincts through beautiful imagery.
